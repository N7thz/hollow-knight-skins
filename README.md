## 📜 Sources

The skins were gathered from various corners of the internet. A special thanks to **ColetteMSLP** for compiling a detailed list and to the *Hollow Knight* Discord communities (**main** and **modding**) for dedicating countless hours to tracking down skin files.

Each skin in the list includes a link to its original source. If a link is broken, please let me know—all skins on this website are archived internally, and broken links can be replaced. You can reach me via:

If you know of a skin that is not listed, feel free to request its addition via [GitHub Discussions](#) or by contacting me directly.

You can download a `.zip` file containing a directory for each skin. Each directory includes a `metadata.json` file and a `preview.png` image. Skins that do not feature playable characters are not yet included in this archive, but are planned to be added later.
